<p>In general, IQA methods include</p>
<p>1) <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>subjective methods</strong></span>:based on the human observer&rsquo;s perceptual evaluation.</p>
<p>2) <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>objective methods</strong></span>:based on computational models automatically predicting<br />the image quality.</p>
<p>subjective methods are more in line with our need but<em> inconvenient</em>, <em>time-consuming</em> and <em>expensive</em>.Subjective methods lack of accurate perceptual metrics so here we focus on objective methods include PSNR, SSIM and MSSIM.</p>

In general,In general, IQA methods include : 
1) subjective methods:based on the human observerâ€™s perceptual evaluation.
2) objective methods:based on computational models automatically predicting
the image quality.

Subjective methods are more in line with our need but inconvenient, time-consuming and expensive.Subjective methods lack of accurate perceptual metrics so here we focus on objective methods include PSNR, SSIM and MSSIM.
